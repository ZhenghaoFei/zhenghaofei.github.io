        <h3>Strawberry Robotic Operation Interface: An Open-Source Device for Collecting Dexterous Manipulation Data in Robotic Strawberry Cultivation</h3>
        <p>Linsheng Hou Wenwu Lu Yanan Wang Chen Peng Zhenghao Fei</p>
        <p>Strawberry cultivation is labor-intensive, particularly for tasks requiring dexterous manipulation, such as harvesting occluded strawberries. Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach to enable robotic arms to perform such functions with human-like dexterity. However, training precise manipulation policies requires large-scale, high-quality demonstration data, which is often challenging to obtain in unstructured field environments. To address this challenge, we introduce the Strawberry Robotic Operation Interface (SROI)â€”an open-source device designed for collecting dexterous manipulation data in robotic strawberry cultivation. The SROI consists of a handheld unit with a modular end effector and a stereo
